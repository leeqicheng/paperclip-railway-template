# ---------- Fix for GitHub issue #4 ----------
# Claude Code refuses --dangerously-skip-permissions when it detects
# root / sudo / elevated capabilities.  `gosu` drops uid/gid but keeps
# inherited Linux capabilities, which Claude Code interprets as elevated
# privilege.
#
# `setpriv` (util-linux, pre-installed on Debian Bookworm) lets us
# explicitly clear all inherited + ambient capabilities so the child
# process looks like a genuinely unprivileged user.
#
# We also unset any SUDO_* env vars that might leak from the container
# runtime, as Claude Code checks for those too.
